ABOUT
=====

Modifies a RHEL 6.4+ x86_64 Workstation or Server DVD with a kickstart
that will install a system that is configured and hardened for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. 

The kickstart script involves the integration of the following projects 
into a single installer:

   - hardening-script-*.el6.noarch.rpm (Hardening scripts RPM)
   
        https://github.com/fcaviggia/hardening-script-el6

   - classification-banner.py (Python for displaying graphical classification banner)
   
        https://github.com/RedHatGov/classification-banner

   - SCAP Security Guide (SSG) Content - Benchmark for the system after installation
   
        https://github.com/OpenSCAP/scap-security-guide

   - DOD Firefox Plugin
   
        http://www.forge.mil/Resources-Firefox.html


CONTENT
=======

createiso.sh - installation script to modify RHEL 6.4+ ISO image
/config - Kickstarts, Python, and RPMs needed to modify image.
	isolinux/
		grub.conf - Menu Configuration for Kickstart
		isolinux.cfg - Menu Configuration for Kickstart
	stig-fix/
		stig-fix.cfg
		
			Kickstart Configuration (Calls menu.py in %pre)
		
		menu.py
		
			Python Script that presents a graphical menu to modify the
			kickstart. Contains the "Profiles" for configuring the 
			system partitioning and packages.

		classification-banner.py
		
			Graphical Classification Banner (for GNOME Desktops User/
			Developer Workstation Profiles)

		dod_firefox_config.tar.gz

			DOD Firefox Plugin and DOD Root CA Certificates for NIPR (SPIR
			CAs would need to be added and repackaged via taring up the
			.mozzilla directory - placed in /etc/skel for all users.

		hardening-script-*-el6.noarch.rpm

			RPM Created from my fork of Tresys CLIP, Aqueduct, NSA SNAC, and USGCB here:

				https://github.com/fcaviggia/hardening-script-el6

			The hardening is run at the last part of the kickstart script to
			lockdown the system, this could theoretically be replaced by the
			SCAP Security Guide Scripts below at a later date.

		scap-security-guide-*.el6.noarch.rpm

			Currently I use ths SSG Scripts to take a benchmark to save in
			root after installation. Updated to the latest version.

		rhevm-preinstall.sh
		rhevm-postinstall.sh

			Scripts to losen settings temporararily to allow registration
			of the system with RHEV-M by allowing root login and allowing
			exec in /tmp. Run rhevm-postinstall.sh after system is added
			into RHEV-M. Copied to /root after kickstart install.

		iptables.sh

			Configures firewall settings to reccomended ports for each 
			product or profile. Copied to /root after kickstart
			install.

		ipa-pam-configuration.sh

			Configures system for using IPA/IdM authentication by
			overwriting the pam.d configurations. Copied to /root
			after kickstart installation/
